I am a highly motivated software development student and am eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to innovative and user-friendly web applications.

My passion for front-end development stems from my fascination with creating visually appealing and interactive interfaces that provide seamless user experiences. I am proficient in the core front-end development languages and frameworks (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind), PHP and MySQL. I am actively expanding my skillset by exploring popular frameworks like React and VUE JS.

Beyond my technical skills, I possess strong problem-solving abilities and a collaborative spirit. I am a quick learner, eager to adapt and embrace new technologies. I am particularly interested in the potential of front-end development to improve access to information and services in solving real-world problems and achieving positive social change, and I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute my skills towards this goal.

In my free time, I enjoy super movies and series if I am not working on my personal and group projects, which further fuels my creativity and problem-solving skills. I am always looking for ways to learn and grow as a developer, and I am excited to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic and collaborative team.

Skills: VUE JS / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
